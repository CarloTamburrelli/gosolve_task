## Find the index of a number

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

To start the project:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command builds the Docker images and starts the two containers:


- **frontend**: react + vite
- **backend**: Flask

The configuration file `.env` is located in the root of the project.
